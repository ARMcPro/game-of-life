# Conway's Game of Life

Sorry for the unreadable code.

## Controls:
- Click or tap a cell to toggle its state.
- Drag to pan the camera.
- Use the mouse wheel or pinch the screen to change the camera zoom.


## Rules:
The neighbors of a cell are its eight adjacent cells.

- Any live cell with fewer than two neighbors dies.
- Any live cell with two or three neighbors will stay alive for the next iteration.
- Any live cell with more than three neighbors dies.
- Any dead cell with exactly three neighbors becomes alive.
